>>Basic structure of establishing a database connection and using mysqli queries (prep and execution) is referenced from the tutorial solution scripts. I have adapted them to suit my purpose but the basic approach for using mysqli is drawn from the example in the tutorial solutions.

For some of the more tricky techniques including use of isset for accessing the $_GET contents safely, I used this website: 
>>http://php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php

>>I have also used references from W3Schools for php syntax, methods for creating multidimensional arrays and in particular use of the super global variable $_GET. 

>>I have also used examples from the lecture notes as a base for my use of the $_GET superglobal. 

>>Used knowledge gained in our module on Relational Databases & Information Systems to form my sql queries and used MySQL Workbench to double check these queries. 

FOR ERROR HANDLING: 
>>I have a check in place in case the connection dies. 
>>I have a check in place in case the query doesn't return any results. 
>>I have a check in place in case the $_GET doesn't contain anything (i.e. nothing has been selected yet). 

Notes on approach: 
>>I tried to keep my website as minimal as possible - in design and in pre-loaded information. 

>>I used php throughout without any use of javascript. I understand that it is possible to load the information and then use javascript to show/hide the divs based on selection. But while I can see that this is fine for this assignment, because the database is quite small, that it is not a scalable solution and I wanted to learn techniques that would applicable to bigger projects in the future. 

>>As a result for any of the additional information that the user can select - the query is sent to the database only when the user selects to view that piece of information. I would be curious to know whether this process would slow down the website if we were dealing with large amounts of data.
